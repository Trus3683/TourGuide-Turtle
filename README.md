# TourGuide-Turtle
Tekkub's TourGuide Addon backported for WoW 1.12 *with tweaks for TurtleWoW*

Recommended Downloads: 

[**TomTom-TWOW**](https://github.com/laytya/TomTom-TWOW)
* **Arrow to navigate you to next guide point**
* you have to disable arrow from pfQuest as its showing closest quest, not optimal path - TomTom is integrated directly to TourGuide and shoudl be used instead

[**pfQuest & pfUI**](https://shagu.org)
* pfQuest adds many features like tracking, map icons etc.
* pfUI provides so much more, overall UI overhaul but all features can be tweaked and disabled if you dont like them

Optional addon: [TourGuide_Professions](https://github.com/Lorwik/TourGuide_Professions)


**Features**
* Automatic detection of objective completion
  * Detect quest accept, completion and turnin
  * Detect travel (by foot, flight, boat and stone)
  * Detection of flight point discovery
  * Detection of Hearth point change
* Conditionals based on player’s class and item possession (only tell the player to accept the quest if they have the item that starts the quest)
* Small “lego block” style frame shows current objective, detailed tooltips on hover
* “Use item” frame, for those annoying quests where you have to use an item on a mob before you kill it, or you have to equip something, or you have to use an item to start a quest
* Pop out frame for detailed view of quest sequence
* Automatic mapping of coordinates with TomTom and questgiver locations from pfQuest if installed

Guides list, plus few others didnt make it into the screenshot (Plaguelands, Silithus, Winterspring), too many for one screen xD
